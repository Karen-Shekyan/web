<p>First, place your bowl firmly on a table/counter. Then, open your cereal package (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sugar-free-cereal">here</a> are some sugar-free options) and pour an optimal amount into the bowl. Then, pour milk 
into the bowl. Lastly, use your spoon to enjoy your bowl of cereal!</p>
