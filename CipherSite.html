<h1>History of Ciphers</h1>

<h2>Ye Olde Ciphers</h2>

<p>The use of encoding methods dates thousands of years back. Old ciphers usually relied on encryption based on substitution or transposition of letters using relatively simple methods. These ciphers have fallen out of use since they can be cracked by hand, which is not a practical way to keep a secret. Regardless, they were used to transfer messages, typically during times of war, before the 1970s. Despite their weaknesses however, old ciphers are sometimes used today to strengthen modern ones.</p>

<p>Subsitution ciphers are the most common type of old cipher. These ciphers simply replaced letters (or sometimes syllables) with other letters. A common example is the Caesar cipher (above), in which letters are shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. Due to its simplicity, this cipher can be cracked with nothing more than brute force. More notable is the Vigenere cipher, which uses the table below to encode a phrase. It matches letters from the phrase (plaintext) to letters in a keyword to create the encrypted text. While this method is more secure due to the possibility of multiple letters being subsituted by the same one, it is still vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination">Kasiski's examination</a> and other such methods. An incredible successor to these ciphers was The Great Cipher. Invented in the 17th century in France, it used subsitution tables and a codebook to substitute syllables rather than letters. It's a redundant, inefficient cipher that 
remained unbroked for two and a half centuries. But perhaps the most famous substitution ciphers are the Enigma code and Morse code. The Enigma code was invented and used by Germany during World War II. Though it is complex as far as substitution ciphers go, it was still cracked fairly quick. Morse code, in contrast, is a very simple cipher intended less for security and more for speed. It was invented by artist Samuel Morse in 1838 and is loosely based off the frequencies of letters in English.</p>

<h2>Modern Ciphers</h2>
<p>Modern ciphers are generally considered to be those created after the 1970s, when new methods of encryption came about. While old methods came down to tables and brute force, modern methods seem like they belong in advanced math books and are impossible to crack without the aid of computers. The ciphers used today can be distunguished by their input data and their use of keys. First, they may either be 'block ciphers' or 'stream ciphers'. Block ciphers turn a phrase phrase into blocks of fixed sizes before encrypting. In contrast, stream ciphers turns a phrase into single bits and encrypts them one-by-one. These have advantages in their own right: stream ciphers operate faster while block ciphers are more secure. As such, the most popular ciphers today are block ciphers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-128</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>, though the stream cipher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4">RC4</a> 
remains in use. Modern ciphers also use keys, typically a big number, to encrypt and decrypt information. A cipher may be either symmetric (like RC4 and AES-128), meaning it uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt, or asymmetric (like RSA), using an encryption key that is different from the decryption key. In asymmetric encryption, only the decryption key must be kept secret (thus being called the private key). The advantage of symmetric encryption and the reason for its widespread use today is that it is efficient for large amounts of data. Naturally, asymmetric encryption is more secure due to its use of more keys. Ironically, asymmetric ciphers are so secure that losing the private key may be irreparable.</p>
